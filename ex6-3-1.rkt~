(draw-circle (make-posn X-BULBS Y-GREEN) BULB-RADIUS 'green)

;; we start with the above
;; now, we need to develop a function called clear-bulb
;; it consumes a symbol that denotes one of the possible colors
;; and it produces true
;; its effect is to 'turn off' the matching bulb in the traffic light

;; clear-bulb : symbol -> true
;; to 'turn off' the bulb in the traffic light that corresponds to the color passed in

;; data analysis
;; we have four distinct possibilities we need to handle
;; red, yellow, green, and [other]
;; red -> turn off the red bulb, return true
;; yellow -> turn off the yellow bulb, return true
;; green -> turn off the green bulb, return true
;; [other] -> just return true
;; we need a conditional expression with 4 condition clauses

;; examples
;; see above

;; let's sketch out the structure of the definition
;(define (clear-bulb color)
;  (cond
;    [... ...]
;    [... ...]
;    [... ...]
;    [... ...]))

;; now let's pop in the conditions
;(define (clear-bulb color)
;  (cond
;    [(symbol=? color 'red) ...]
;    [(symbol=? color 'yellow) ...]
;    [(symbol=? color 'green) ...]
;    [else ...]))

;; ...aaaand add the answers
;; we realize we need a helper
(define (clear-bulb color)
  (cond
    [(symbol=? color 'red) (and (disk-to-circle Y-RED 'red) true)]
    [(symbol=? color 'yellow) (and (disk-to-circle Y-YELLOW 'yellow) true)]
    [(symbol=? color 'green) (and (disk-to-circle Y-GREEN 'green) true)]
    [else true]))

;; ...so let's define the helper
(define (disk-to-circle y color)
  (and
   (clear-solid-disk (make-posn X-BULBS y) BULB-RADIUS color)
   (draw-circle (make-posn X-BULBS y) BULB-RADIUS color)))

;; and let's test that our function works as expected
;; observe the results on the canvas as well
(clear-bulb 'red)
(clear-bulb 'yellow)
(clear-bulb 'green)
(clear-bulb 'blue)

;; --------------------------
;; cool. now, for 6.2.3, let's develop draw-bulb

;; draw-bulb : symbol -> true
;; to 'light' one of the traffic bulbs

;; data analysis
;; again, 4 cases:
;; 'red, 'yellow', 'green, and [other]
;; all return true
;; the first three light the corresponding bulb
;; again, we need a 4-clause conditional expression

;; examples
;; see above

;; structural definition + conditions
;; cos we are baller enough to do both at once
;(define (draw-bulb color)
;  (cond
;    [(symbol=? color 'red) ...]
;    [(symbol=? color 'yellow) ...]
;    [(symbol=? color 'green) ...]
;    [else true]))

;; now let us flesh out the def with answers
;; as often, we realize we need a helper
(define (draw-bulb color)
  (cond
    [(symbol=? color 'red) (circle-to-disk Y-RED 'red)]
    [(symbol=? color 'yellow) (circle-to-disk Y-YELLOW 'yellow)]
    [(symbol=? color 'green) (circle-to-disk Y-GREEN 'green)]
    [else true]))

;; ...so we define it
(define (circle-to-disk y color)
  (and
   (clear-circle (make-posn X-BULBS y) BULB-RADIUS color)
   (draw-solid-disk (make-posn X-BULBS y) BULB-RADIUS color)))

;; ... and then we test that we can turn the lights on!
(draw-bulb 'red)
(draw-bulb 'yellow)
(draw-bulb 'green)
(draw-bulb 'blue)

;; cool. now, for 6.2.4, let's develop switch

;; switch : symbol symbol -> true
;; to switch the stoplight from the first color to the second color

;; since we have designed draw-bulb and clear-bulb
;; to handle any symbol input without error,
;; we can simple call clear-bulb and draw-bulb in sequence,
;; passing in the first and second arguments respectively

;; example
;; (switch 'green 'yellow) -> true, green bulb switches off, yellow turns on

(define (switch old-color new-color)
  (and
   (clear-bulb old-color)
   (draw-bulb new-color)))

;; now we test
;; at the end of this sequence, we should have one lit bulb - yellow
(clear-bulb 'red)
(clear-bulb 'yellow)
(clear-bulb 'green)
(draw-bulb 'green)
(switch 'green 'yellow)


;; cool. now, for 6.2.5, let's mess around with a function called next

;; next : symbol -> symbol
;; to switch a traffic light's current color and to return the next one
(define (next current-color)
  (cond
    [(and
      (symbol=? current-color 'red)
      (switch 'red 'green))
     'green]
    [(and
      (symbol=? current-color 'yellow)
      (switch 'yellow 'red))
     'red]
    [(and
      (symbol=? current-color 'green)
      (switch 'green 'yellow))
     'yellow]))


;; now, let's start with a red, and switch four times
;; we should end at green
(switch 'yellow 'red)
(next (next (next (next 'red))))
