; 8.7.1. legal or illegal?

; 1
; (define-struct personnel-record (name salary dob ssn))
; legal, because it starts with an open paren,
; continues with the define-struct keyword,
; then has a variable,
; then has a sequence of variables in parens,
; and then ends with a closing paren matching the one before define-struct
; CORRECT

; 2
; (define-struct oops ())
; illegal
; there is not at least one variable in the parens after the first
; WRONG - it is LEGAL - there is no problem with having zero names

; 3
; (define-struct child (dob date (- date dob)))
; illegal
; (- date dob) is an expression but not a variable
; CORRECT

; 4
; (define-struct (child person) (dob date))
; illegal
; first var must be by itself and not in parens
; CORRECT

; 5
; (define-struct child (parents dob date))
; legal
; same structure as 1, which is syntactically valid
; CORRECT
