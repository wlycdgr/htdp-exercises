;; 1. (define (f x) 'x)
;; Legal
;; You've got define right after the opening left parenthesis
;; Then you've got 2+ variables inside a set of parens
;; Then you've got a valid expression - a bare constant is one
;; Then you've got your required closing right paren
;; So, you've got everything you need, and nothing that's not allowed

;; 2. (define (f 'x) x)
;; Illegal
;; Mostly fine BUT the parens after the define contain a symbol constant
;; Only variables are allowed there

;; 3. (define (f x y) (+ 'y (not x)))
;; Legal
;; You've got the opening left paren,
;; The define keyword right after it,
;; The 2+ only-vars in parens right after,
;; A valid expression (maybe not sensical, but grammatically valid!)
;; right after
;; And the required closing right paren right after
