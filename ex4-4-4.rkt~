;; data analysis
;; we have 4 distinct cases:
;; $500 and under
;; over $500 to $1500
;; over $1500 to $2500
;; over $2500

;; examples:
;; $0 -> $0 // boundary
;; $300 -> $0.75
;; $500 -> $1.25 // boundary
;; $800 -> $1.25 + $1.50 = $2.75
;; $1500 -> $1.25 + $5 = $6.25 // boundary
;; $2000 -> $1.25 + $5 + $3.75 = $10
;; $2500 -> $1.25 + $5 + $7.50 = $13.75 // boundary
;; $3000 -> $1.25 + $5 + $7.50 + $5 = $18.75
