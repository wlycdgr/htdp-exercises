; do all lists of 2 symbols also belong to the class list-of-symbols?
; provide a concise argument

; every list of 2 symbols consists of a symbol
; and an element that consists of a symbol and empty
; empty is a list-of-symbols by part 1 of the definition
; a symbol and a list-of-symbols is a list-of-symbols by part 2 of the definition
; therefore, the element is a list-of-symbols
; therefore, the list of 2 symbols is a list-of-symbols by part 2 of the definition
