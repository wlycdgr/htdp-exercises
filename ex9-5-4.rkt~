; develop the function dollar-store? which
; consumes a list of prices and returns true if all are below $1

; contract
; dollar-store : list-of-numbers -> boolean

; purpose
; to determine whether each number in a list of numbers
; that represent prices in dollars is below 1

; definition
(define (dollar-store? lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) true]
    [else (and (< (first lon) 1)
               (dollar-store? (rest lon)))]))

; tests
(dollar-store? empty)
(not (dollar-store? (cons .75 (cons 1.95 (cons .25 empty)))))
(dollar-store? (cons .15 (cons .05 (cons .25 empty))))

; generalize the function
(define (x-store? lon x)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) true]
    [else (and (< (first lon) x)
               (x-store? (rest lon) x))]))
