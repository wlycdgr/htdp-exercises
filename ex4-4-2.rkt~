;; interest : number -> number
;; to compute the amount of interest earned in a year for a given deposit amount >= 0

;; data analysis step
;; there are 3 distinct situations:
;; a deposit up to $1000
;; a deposit greater than $1000 but less than or equal to $5000
;; a deposit of more than $5000

;; examples, covering all borderline cases
;; amount = 0, should be 0
;; amount = 500, should be 20

;; amount = 3000, should be 135
