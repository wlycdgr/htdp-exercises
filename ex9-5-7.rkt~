; develop the function delta,
; which consumes two price lists (that is, lists of numbers)
; the first represents the inventory at the beginning of a time period
; the second represents the inventory at the end
; the function outputs the difference in value (positive if it has increased, negative if it has decreased)

; contract
; delta : lon lon -> number

; purpose
; to calculate the difference between the total values of an inventory at two points in time

; definition
(define (delta lon-start lon-end)
  (- (sum lon-end) (sum lon-start)))

; helper that sums the values in a list of numbers
(define (sum lon)
  (cond
    [(empty? lon) 0]
    [else (+ (first lon) (sum (rest lon)))]))

; tests
(define l1 (cons 5 (cons 12 (cons 4 empty))))
(define l2 (cons 11 (cons 7 empty)))

(= 3 (delta l2 l1))
(= -3 (delta l1 l2))
